# Radial-Schrodinger

In this project, we aim to numerically solve the radial component of the Schr√∂dinger equation
$$\left(-\frac{1}{2\mu} \frac{d^2}{dr^2} + \frac{\ell(\ell + 1)}{2\mu r^2} + V(r)\right) u_{n, \ell}(r) = E_{n, \ell} u_{n, \ell}(r)$$
for any given confining potential V(r). 

The primary focus is on determining the bound state wavefunctions $u_{n, \ell}(r)$ and the corresponding energy eigenvalues $E_{n, \ell}$. We employ a range of numerical analysis techniques, including the Numerov method, the shooting method, bisection search, and Newton's method, to achieve our computational objectives.
